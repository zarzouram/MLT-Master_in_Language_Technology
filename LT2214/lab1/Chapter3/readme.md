Sorry for this late submission. This topic is entirely new for me, and it took me a long time to practice it.

For the first 25 sentences that are in PUD, I had done my tagging on my own then went back to the PUD to compare it with my answer. Most of the time, I find many differences; therefore, I go back to the UD documentation to figure out what I have misunderstood. This procedure takes me a lot of time.

Still, I face difficulties in correctly define `advcl` `xcopm`, and `csubj`.

There are some difficulties that I have faced in Arabic PUD, for examples:

1. In sentence ID 5: A `NOUN` (word-6) that are tagged to have `advmod` dependency as it modifies a verb (word-1). My view was it is an object. *Actually, the differences between the traditional grammars and the UD consumes most of the time to adapt with.*

1. In sentence ID 7: In the original UD, a word number 4 is tagged as `NOUN`. This something that I cannot understand as the word is a `VERB`. And of course, this POS tagging affect the dependency. I have done my answer based on my understanding.

2. In sentence ID 9: Word number-5 has a tag of `ADP` in the original UD. However, my understanding is that it has the same function as `when`. I have done my answer based on my knowledge. Also, the translation is different.

3. In general, I have confusion when it comes to the "participles" and "verbal noun" in Arabic. For example, in sentence ID 12, word number 12 is a verbal noun, so it has POS of "NOUN". My understanding that the adpositional phrase (word number 11&12) could be seen to have an oblique relation with the verbal noun. The same for sentence ID 12, the "verbal noun" is word number 6.
