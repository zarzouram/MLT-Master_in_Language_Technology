it depends.  if you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform
at a higher level than your young talent can *now*, why not the talent 
develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer.
if the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right.

>maybe someone should tell those renegade front office people in denver. :)

open question -- which was more important to the expansion clubs, the expansion
draft or the regular draft.  (they've had one of each, i think.)
